## Number Guesser from The Rust Programming Language book

This is the number guesser program following the tutorial in [Chap 2 of The Rust Programming Language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html). It contains the code used in the tutorial, plus a few of my own additions and some comments to explain the code. In particular, since I am coming from JavaScript, the comments help me understand the Rust concepts by using JS parallels where appropriate.
